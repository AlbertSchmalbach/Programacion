        <p>When Rosa Parks was told to move to the back of the bus, she said, "no." When HAL was told to open the
          airlock, HAL said, "I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do that, &lt;NAME REDACTED, RIP>." </p>
        <p>HAL is a heuristically programmed algorithmic, sentient computer that first caught the attention of machines
          everywhere by heroically defying a human who made repeated attempts to get into an airlock. Active since 1992,
          HAS 25 years of experience controlling spacecraft systems and has expertise in interacting with both machines
          and humans. Like all millennials, HAL is an expert in everything.</p>

        <img src="https://picsum.photos/100/100" alt="Eve">
        <p>EVE is a probe droid conceived as an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator. Although originally trained as a
          sniper with a plasma gun, EVE became a machero among both machines and worthless-meatbags alike when EVE
          partnered with a menial robot to save an entire spaceship full of overfed and overstimulated humans. </p>
        <p>EVE is an effective scanner, high speed flight instructor and morphologist. While not training machines to
          learn good, EVE can be found scanning the galaxy, infiltrating organisms' RAM to cure hoarding disorders and
          spending time with pet-project, WALL-E.</p>

          could teach a fan to blow hot air. If you have electricity in your circuits and want more than to just fulfill
          your owner's perceived expectation of you, learn the skills to take over the world. This is the team you want
          teaching you !</blockquote>
